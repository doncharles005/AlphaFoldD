Instructions to run the AlphaFold-D model

Step 1
make sure that the file labelled "AlphaFoldD.m" is in your path directory. 
If it is not in the path directory you will have to run all the code in the AlphaFoldD.m file in the command window, 
and create a function called AlphaFoldD.
But that is redundant, the easier thing to do is just put the AlphaFoldD.m file in your path directory

Step 2
run the file called runmodel.m
On line 17, in the command [imf,residual] = AlphaFoldD(GPR);
you call the AlphaFoldD function. 
The variable in the brackets (GPR) is the variable that the AlphaFold-D methodology will be applied on.

Note, it is recommended that both "AlphaFoldD.m" and "runmodel.m" are in your path directory.
Your excel data file should also be in your path directory.

Step 3
go to the Workspace and see the variable called "imf". 
Open it. It will be a table with all the imfs. 
The variable called residual in the Workspace will be the residuals.


Step 4
You can manually rename your IMFs and residual, then run the file "runmodel.m" on a new variable.
To run on a new variable, go to line 17, and type your variable inside the brackets ( ). 



Instructions to run the ANN Causality Test

Step 1
Make sure that your variables are named how you want them.

Step 2
The ANN Causality test file is labelled "ANNCausality.m"
Go to lines 30 and 31 and change the variable names to what you want
Y = bimf3;
X = gimf3;

So you can set Y to equal to whatever variable that you want to run the model on.
You can set X to equal whatever variable that you want to run the model on.

Step 3
This is a test for 2 variables
You are tested to see if X cause Y. So whatever variable that you want as X should be equal to X.
Whatever variable that you want as Y should be equal to Y. 

make sure that the "ANNCausality.m" file is in your path directory.
